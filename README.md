Variations of this challenge are pretty common in code interviews and phone screens for software engineering. The task may differ but the fundamentals are usually pretty much the same - Given a file, read it, and parse the data.

##Instructions
- Read the `speech.txt` file and display a count of the most commonly used words in the document.
- Your list of commonly used words should be human readable and in descending order by count.
